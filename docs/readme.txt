A bomb defuser game created for Android as part of a Class Project. It is basically a version of Minesweeper, where the task of the user is to defuse (tap on) bombs instead of hitting empty tiles.

For this project, I made custom buttons without borders and added a nice image on the main menu.
When scanning for the mines an animation along row/column is shown.
The app displays a "pulse wave" effect along row/column when scanning for mines by using fade-in and fade-out alternatively.
The app also plays a sound as the tiles are being scanned and when a mine is found.
An explosion sound effect is played when a mine is found along with a buzzer sound effect when the bomb is not found.
The state of the game is saved even if it gets closed while being played and would restart from where it was.
Restarting the application keeps the chosen board size and bomb number constant.

Here is a demo while the application is running:
