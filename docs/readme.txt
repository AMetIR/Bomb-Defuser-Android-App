Made custom buttons without borders; added a nice image on the main menu
Scanning animation along row/column when scanning for mines:
Created a "pulse wave" effect along row/column when scanning for mines by using 
fade-in and fade-out alternatively.


Plays sound on scan and on find a mine:
Used an explosion sound effect when mine is found, and a buzzer sound effect
when bomb is not found.

Save game state if app closed while game playing.- Restarting app restarts game where you were.
Restarting application keeps your chosen board size and bomb number constant.

Here is a demo while application is running:
